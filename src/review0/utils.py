def pdf_to_text(filename, highlight_headers=[]):
    """
    Extract text from a PDF file and return both the full text and the highlight 
    that includes certain sections if provided. 
    This function reads a PDF file, extracts its text content, and optionally
    extracts and highlights specific sections of the text based on provided
    header pairs.
    Args:
        filename (str): The path to the PDF file to be processed.
        highlight_headers (list of tuple, optional): A list of tuples where each tuple
            contains two strings representing the start and end headers of the sections
            to be highlighted. Defaults to an empty list.
    Returns:
        tuple:
            - str: The full extracted text from the PDF.
            - str: The concatenated text of the highlighted sections, if any.
    Notes:
        - If a section defined by the start and end headers is not found in the text,
          a message will be printed indicating the missed section and its headers.
        - The function assumes that the headers provided in `highlight_headers` are
          unique and appear in the text in the correct order.
    Example:
        text, text_highlight = pdf_to_text("example.pdf", [("Abstract", "Introduction"), ("Conclusion", "References")])
